# Ford Gobike System Data Exploration

## by Mohamed Salama

## Project Overview
This project has two parts that demonstrate the importance and value of data visualization techniques in the data analysis process.

* In Part I, Exploratory data visualization, you will use Python visualization libraries to systematically explore a selected dataset, starting from plots of single variables and building up to plots of multiple variables.
* In Part II, Explanatory data visualization, you will produce a short presentation that illustrates interesting properties, trends, and relationships that you discovered in your selected dataset. The primary method of conveying your findings will be through transforming your exploratory visualizations from the first part into polished, explanatory visualizations.


## Dataset

> Dataset FordGoBike for the month of February 2019, The data contains approximately 1,860,000 individual trip records with 16 variables collected, After adding important variables to the exploratory analysis, we have 20 variables, You can view the dataset through this link:

## Summary of Findings

> The length of the trip depends on the age of the member, so we find that the longest trip recorded by members is from the age of 20 to 40, especially from the age of 30 to 35, and we find that the gender of the member affects the use of this service, so we find that males use it more than women and the type of user also, we find that subscribers are more  to use this service from customer.


## Key Insights for Presentation

> Although males use this service more than women, we find that women use trips for longer periods than men. Also, customers use the service on long trips, while subscribers use it for shorter periods, which indicates that they use it on short distances.
